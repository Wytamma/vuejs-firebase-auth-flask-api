# vuejs-firebase-auth-flask-api
I extended Anas Mammeri's vue.js/firebase tutorial [Vue 2 + Firebase: How to build a Vue app with Firebase authentication system in 15 minutes](https://medium.com/@anas.mammeri/vue-2-firebase-how-to-build-a-vue-app-with-firebase-authentication-system-in-15-minutes-fdce6f289c3c) to include a flask backend. Clone this repo to get new ideas off the ground quicker.

## setup /api
Replace missing configs:
 - api/config add `_passwords.py` (server email details)
 - api/config add `firebase-adminsdk.json` (firebase-sdk-file)

Commands:
 - `pipenv install` (install dependancies)
 - `export FLASK_APP=app.py`
 - `flask run` (start server)

## setup /webapp
Replace missing configs:
 - webapp/config add `firebase.config.json` (firebase-sdk-file)

Commands:
 - `npm install` (install dependancies)
 - `npm run dev` (serve with hot reload at localhost:8080)
 - `npm run build` (build for production with minification)

## basics
when you load localhost:8080 you'll be directed to a login page. click the link to create a new account. i made a design choice here... firebase won't verify email before you create an account. I use the flask backend to do email verification before account creation. enter details, get link, set password, login.

## production
The idea is that the backend will be run on separate server and the frontend build will be hosted on aws s3.
